# Machine-Learning-Classification

This repository maintains variety of Machine Learning Calssification Algorithms.

With this project we able to know which Classification algorithm suits whcih type of problems.

# Description

In this project we explore Classification techniques. In general Classification algorithms are divided into two types

1) Binary Classification 

2) Multi Class Classification

In Binary Classification our Class label or Target variable or Y variable will have only two class labels i.e class labels only contain either YES or NO and 0 or 1 like...

In Multi Class Classification our class label or Target variable or dependent variable will contain more than two class labels.

Our project explores following Classification Algorithms :

1) Logistic Regression ( Though the name contain regression this is a classification algorithm )

2) K-Nearest Neighbours(KNN) ( Where K represents number of nearest neighbours )

3) Support Vector Machines for Classification

4) Kernel SVM ( where we explore all the kernels of SVM like "linear","rbf","poly" )

5) Naive Bayes Classification ( Probabilistic Interpretation for Classification )

6) Decision Tree Classification

7) Random Forest Classification ( Similar to Decision Trees except the Number of Estimators used )
